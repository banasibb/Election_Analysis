## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee requested an audit of a recent congressional election. As part of this audit, the following tasks were required:
  1. Calculate a total number of votes cast.
  2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
  3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
  5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Challenge Overview
In order to perform the analysis of the CSV election data, Microsoft Virtual Studio Code was used to read the CSV file and to create a text file to hold the output of the analysis findings. <br />
<br />To perform the calculations required in the analysis, variables were assigned to establish the candidate options, calculate the total votes, and determine the winning candidate based on the vote count as a percentage of total.
